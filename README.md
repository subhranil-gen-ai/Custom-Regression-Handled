# Custom-Regression-Handled

Custom-handled regression models: Normal Equation, Gradient Descent, and SGD, built using NumPy.

# ðŸ“Š Custom Regression-Handled(From Scratch)

- This project implements Regression using three approaches:

  - Normal Equation (Closed Form)
  - Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Each is compared against Scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression for validation.

# ðŸš€ Features

- Synthetic dataset generation (TV, Radio, Newspaper ads â†’ Sales)
- Custom implementations with NumPy
- Feature scaling for gradient descent
- Side-by-side comparison with Scikit-learn
